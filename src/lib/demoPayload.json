  "summary": "This demo article highlights a global policy debate. The reporting is fact-based but shows signs of loaded language and selective framing. While Reuters and AP provide neutral accounts, BBC and NYTimes include interpretive angles. Politico emphasizes political stakes, while Der Spiegel and El País provide valuable international context. The piece would benefit from more expert counter-opinions and regional impact analysis.",
